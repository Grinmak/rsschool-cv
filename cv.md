**About me:**

Major part of my career I spent in sales. Worked both as a salesman and sales manager. Eventually i gained a courage to tell my self that all that sales-thing not my cup of tee. Then switched to cnc-operator. And now, working on a factory, been able to eficently manipulate most of machines here i see a fewer oportunities to grow further, to learn more. And coding - there is no limits, it`s really exiting. I love to create: photoshop, premiere pro, any kind of filmmaiking, when you can see how small things combine and become  the 'whole', something completly new. Coding gives me the same feeling of satisfaction when mind-skills can transform into real thing.
